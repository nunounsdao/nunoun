                  The nuNouns Auction Contract will act as a self-sufficient nuNoun generation and

                nuNoun the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to

                  The proposal veto right was initially envisioned as a temporary solution to the
                  problem of ‘51% attacks’ on the uNouns DAO treasury. While Nounders initially
                  believed that a healthy distribution of Nouns would be sufficient protection for
                  the DAO, a more complete understanding of the incentives and risks has led to
                  general consensus within the Nounders, the Nouns Foundation, and the wider
                  community that a more robust game-theoretic solution should be implemented before
                  the right is removed.

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  The Nouns community has undertaken a preliminary exploration of proposal veto
                  alternatives (‘rage quit’ etc.), but it is now clear that this is a difficult
                  problem that will require significantly more research, development and testing
                  before a satisfactory solution can be implemented.

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  Consequently, the Nouns Foundation anticipates being the steward of the veto power
                  until Nouns DAO or nuNounsDAO are ready to implement an alternative, and therefore wishes to
                  clarify the conditions under which it would exercise this power.

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  The nuNounsDAO considers the veto an emergency power that should not be
                  exercised in the normal course of business. nuNounsDAO will veto
                  proposals that introduce non-trivial legal or existential risks to the nuNouns DAO
                  or the nuNouns, including (but not necessarily limited to) proposals
                  that:

                  There are unfortunately no algorithmic solutions for making these determinations
                  in advance (if there were, the veto would not be required), and proposals must be

                  nuNouns are stored directly on Ethereum and do not utilize pointers to other
                  networks such as IPFS. This is possible because nuNoun parts are compressed and
                  stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of
                  lossless compression.

                  The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG
                  image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate
                  format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain
                  string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base64
                  encoded.

                  The nuNoun Seeder contract is used to determine nuNoun traits during the minting

                  algorithm upgrades. Additionally, it can be locked by the nuNouns DAO to prevent any
                  future updates. Currently, nuNoun traits are determined using pseudo-random number
                  generation:

                  Because 100% of nuNoun auction proceeds are sent to nuNouns DAO, nuNounders have chosen
                  to compensate themselves with nuNouns. Every 10th nuNoun for the first 5 years of the
                  project (nuNoun ids #0, #10, #20, #30 and so on) will be automatically sent to the
                  nuNounder's multisig to be vested and shared among the founding members of the
                  project.

                  are sent directly to the nuNounder's Multisig, and auctions continue on schedule
                  with the next available nuNoun ID.

                  nouncubator a community of solid nounish builders to be established by the nuNouns.
                  being passionate proliferators of cc0, nuNounders have chosen to allocate other Nouns extensions 
                  with nuNouns. Every 11th nuNoun for the first 5 years of the project (
                  nuNoun ids #1, #11, #21, #31 and so on) will be automatically sent to the Nouncubator
                  to be utilized collectively as a governance tool to push and support extension projects even further.
